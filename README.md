During my internship at TDK, I collaborated with fellow interns on an exciting project focused on industrial automation. 
Our objective was to establish seamless communication between a PC and a Siemens S7-1500 PLC using Python and the Snap7 library, all within the TIA Portal environment. 
We started by physically connecting the devices and configuring network settings to ensure they could communicate effectively. With Python, we wrote a program to facilitate data exchange, enabling the PC to send inputs to the PLC for automation tasks. 
This experience not only improved my programming skills but also gave me valuable insights into using technology in real-world industry.

In another project, we integrated an air pressure sensor into our industrial automation system using the PLC S7-1500. 
We captured real-time readings, stored them in a database on MS SQL Server, and developed a machine learning model to forecast air pressure values. 
This project demonstrated the seamless integration of sensor data with PLC automation.

Furthermore, we explored data visualization with Tableau in an established Energy Management System (EMS). 
Our focus was on utilizing Tableau for data visualization within an established Energy Management System (EMS). 
While the EMS system and data processing workflows were already established, we contributed by assisting in the development of custom SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database. 
With Tableau, we transformed this data into visually informative bar graphs, presenting trends in energy consumption over various time intervals such as hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly. 
To ensure accuracy, we meticulously cross-checked our Tableau visualizations with corresponding Excel sheets.

Overall, my internship at TDK was invaluable, providing hands-on experience and deepening my understanding of industrial automation, programming, and data analysis.
